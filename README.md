# Project Documentation

## Overview

The aim of this project is to create a Google Chrome plugin that enables software developers to simulate or 'mock' GraphQL request responses. This solution will provide capabilities to intercept outgoing GraphQL requests initiated by the browser, analyze the relevant data, and then deliver fully customizable mock responses.

The tool is designed to increase the efficiency of testing and debugging for applications that employ GraphQL. By mimicking various server responses and observing the subsequent application behavior, developers can simulate a full spectrum of server interactions, including network delays, errors, and variable responses, without the need to alter the actual backend.

## Features

GraphQL Request Interception:

The primary role of the plugin will be to monitor and capture any GraphQL requests made by the browser. 
It should detail the request parameters, query structure, variables, and the destination endpoint, providing developers a comprehensive view of outgoing communication.


Mock Response Configuration:

The plugin will host a user-friendly interface where developers can configure their preferred mock responses for each captured GraphQL query. 
Developers should be able to map specific responses to queries, manipulating both the data and the HTTP status code returned.


Dynamic Response Generation:

In addition to static responses, the plugin will generate dynamic mock responses. 
It will consider the variables present in intercepted GraphQL queries, allowing developers to create more nuanced response patterns and simulate a wider range of behaviors.


Response Delay Simulation:

The plugin will simulate network latency by introducing an adjustable delay before the mock response is returned. 
This function will enable developers to test how their application reacts under slow or unreliable network conditions.


Mock Data Generation:

This feature will generate random or predefined mock data based on the GraphQL endpoint's schema. 
Developers will be able to populate their mock responses with relevant, realistic data, adding further depth to their testing scenarios.


Meaningful Data Generation:

In addition to random data, the plugin will also support generating meaningful mock data for specific fields like name, age, color, animal, profession, country, address, company, domain, email, and so on. 
This feature will enhance the realism of the testing scenarios and improve the quality of the application behavior evaluation.


Concurrent Request Handling:

To accurately mimic real-world situations, the plugin will be capable of handling multiple GraphQL requests simultaneously. 
Whether these simultaneous requests are entirely different or multiple instances of the same query, the plugin should manage and respond to each one independently.


Customizable Response Status Code:

Developers will be allowed to change the HTTP status code returned in the mock response. 
This feature is essential for testing how the application handles different types of server responses, including various error statuses.


Data Validation:

The plugin will ensure that the dynamically generated responses and the produced mock data align with the GraphQL schema. 
This will ensure that the mock responses are correctly formatted and the data types align with the schema definition.


User Interface Integration:

Each of these features will be smoothly integrated into the plugin's user interface.
This will create a unified, easy-to-navigate tool where developers can configure their testing scenarios, manage dynamic variables, adjust response delays, and more.


## Additional Features

Meaningful Data Generation: 

In addition to random data, the plugin will also support generating meaningful mock data for specific fields like name, age, color, animal, profession, country, address, company, domain, email, province, state, and coordinates. 
This feature will enhance the realism of the testing scenarios and improve the quality of the application behavior evaluation.


Fast Randomization:

Fast Randomization will allow users to quickly generate random responses based on previously used mock configurations. 
This means that once a developer has set up a mock response for a particular GraphQL query, they can subsequently generate randomized responses for the same query with a single click, rather than having to manually adjust the response each time.


Type Error Information: 

To assist developers in creating and debugging mock responses, the plugin will incorporate a feature that highlights and provides information on type errors. 
Whenever there is a mismatch between the expected and provided data types in the mock response, the plugin will not only flag the error but also offer details regarding the nature of the mismatch. 

Field Not Found Information: 

In situations where a requested field is missing from the mock response, the plugin will generate a 'Field Not Found' notification. 
This notification will specify the name of the missing field and the context in which it was expected, providing developers with the necessary information to correct the mock response or adjust the request.

Customizable Data Types: 

Recognizing the importance of detailed customization in mock responses, the plugin will offer the ability to customize each data type individually. 
Users can define the structure and values for different data types within the GraphQL schema, such as Int, Float, String, Boolean, Arrays. following a certain pattern. 
This will allow developers to create more precise and relevant mock data, thus enabling more accurate and meaningful testing scenarios.

## Conclusion

The proposed Google Chrome plugin will serve as a comprehensive suite of testing tools for GraphQL-based applications. 
It will handle everything from the creation of mock responses, their delivery, including potential network delays, and validation against the GraphQL schema. 
By offering these features in a user-friendly package, this plugin will streamline the testing process and help improve the quality and reliability of the resulting software.
